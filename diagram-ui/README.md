# Circuit-Simulator UI

Me trying to implement a web UI for this thing
Also it's 2023, so Web-dev has to be complicated and contain unnecessary bloat, therefore React

## Current Stage

- An `asset manager` that loads the assets asynchronously using promises
- An `Element` class to manage state of every element
- A `Board` class to manage everything being drawn and to manage events
  - Board has ha grid system and everything works based on grids
  - No zoom or pan system yet

## TODO (in no particular order)

- [ ] Implement a drag and drop system for components.
- [ ] Implement wires ( sounds simple but it's not going to be! )
- [ ] Implement a zoom and pan system
